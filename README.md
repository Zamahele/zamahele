# One-screen landing page

This folder contains a one-viewport landing page (no scrolling) for BLACK TECH EMPOWER. Replace the files in your GitHub Pages repo and the page will be live.

- Replace existing `index.html` and `styles.css` in the repo root (or in `/docs` if you publish from docs).
- Keep `assets/logo.svg` in the `assets` folder.
- Links:
  - Email CTA goes to `ndimandezj@gmail.com`
  - WhatsApp CTA uses `wa.me/27735904108`
  - Brochure button expects `BLACK_TECH_EMPOWER_Service_Brochure.pdf` in the same folder (optional)
