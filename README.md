# BLACK TECH EMPOWER (Pty) Ltd — Website

This is a simple static site ready for GitHub Pages.

## Quick deploy
1. Create a new repo on GitHub (public). You can name it `black-tech-empower` or `black-tech-empower.github.io` (for user/org pages).
2. Upload all files from this folder (or push with Git).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Branch** = `main` (or `master`), **Folder** = `/root`.
4. Save. Your site will be live at the URL GitHub shows (refresh after a minute).

## Custom domain (optional)
- Add a DNS **CNAME** record pointing your domain to `<your-username>.github.io`.
- In this repo, create a file named `CNAME` containing your domain, e.g. `www.example.co.za`.
- Back in **Settings → Pages**, enforce HTTPS.
